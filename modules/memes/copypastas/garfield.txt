>I was only 9 years old
>I loved Garfield so much, I had all the merchandise and comic strips
>I pray to Garfield every night before bed, thanking him for the life I've been given
>"Garfield is love" I say; "Garfield is life"
>My dad hears me and calls me a faggot
>I know he was just jealous of my devotion for Garfield
>I called him a cunt
>He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep
>I'm crying now, and my face hurts
>I lay in bed and it's really cold
>Suddenly, a warmth is moving towards me
>It's Garfield
>I am so happy
He whispers into my ear "I hate mondays."
>He grabs me with his powerful kitty paws and puts me down onto my hands and knees
>I'm ready
>I spread my ass-cheeks for Garfield
>He penetrates my butt-hole
>It hurts so much but I do it for Garfield
>I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water
>I push against his force
>I want to please Garfield
>He purs in a mighty purs as he fills my butt with his hot sticky lasagna
>My dad walks in
>Garfield looks him straight in the eyes and says "Hot toddies and maseratis."
>Garfield leaves through my window
>Garfield is love. Garfield is life.
